  abstract = {We demonstrate that an ultracold many-body bosonic ensemble confined in a one-dimensional double-well potential exhibits a population imbalance between the two wells at large timescales, when the depth of the wells is modulated by a time-dependent driving force. The specific form of the driving force is shown to break spatial parity and time-reversal symmetries, which leads to such an asymptotic population imbalance (API). The value of the API can be flexibly controlled by changing the phase of the driving force and the total number of particles. While the API is highly sensitive to the initial state in the few-particle regime, this dependence on the initial state is lost as we approach the classical limit of large particle numbers. We perform a Floquet analysis in the few-particle regime and an analysis based on a driven classical nonrigid pendulum in the many-particle regime. Although the obtained API values in the many-particle regime agree very well with those obtained in the classical limit, we show that there exists a significant disagreement in the corresponding real-time population imbalance due to quantum correlations.}

  abstract = {The past two decades have seen a remarkable progress in the development of synthetic colloidal agents which are capable of creating directed motion in an unbiased environment at the microscale. These self-propelling particles are often praised for their enormous potential to self-organize into dynamic nonequilibrium structures such as living clusters, synchronized super-rotor structures or self-propelling molecules featuring a complexity which is rarely found outside of the living world. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the formation and dynamics of many of these structures are still barely understood, which is likely to hinge on the gaps in our understanding of how active colloids interact. In particular, besides showing comparatively short-ranged interactions which are well known from passive colloids (Van der Waals, electrostatic etc), active colloids show novel hydrodynamic interactions as well as phoretic and substrate-mediated `osmotic' cross-interactions which hinge on the action of the phoretic field gradients which are induced by the colloids on other colloids in the system. The present article discusses the complexity and the intriguing properties of these interactions which in general are long-ranged, non-instantaneous, non-pairwise and non-reciprocal and which may serve as key ingredients for the design of future nonequilibrium colloidal materials. Besides providing a brief overview on the state of the art of our understanding of these interactions a key aim of this review is to emphasize open key questions and corresponding open challenges.}

The timescales of such current reversals can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the spatial locations of the superimposed lattices. The key principle behind the current reversals is the conversion of the particle dynamics from chaotic to ballistic, which allow the particles to explore regions of the underlying phase space which are inaccessible otherwise. Our results can be experimentally realized using cold atoms in driven optical lattices and allow for the control of transport of atomic ensembles in such setups.}

Our superlattice consists of a superposition of individual lattices whose potential depths are modulated periodically in time but with different phases. This driving scheme breaks the spatial reflection symmetries and allows an ensemble of particles to rotate with an average angular velocity. An analysis of the underlying dynamical attractors provides an efficient method to control the angular velocities of the particles by changing the driving amplitude. As a result, spatially periodic patterns of particles showing different vortical motions can be created. Possible experimental realizations include holographic optical lattice based setups for colloids or cold atoms.}

The underlying mechanism is based on the fact that dimensional coupling allows the particles to explore regions of phase space which are inaccessible otherwise. The experimental realization for cold atoms in ac-driven optical lattices is discussed.}

This scheme allows one to accelerate, slow, and freeze the transport on demand by switching one of the lattices subsequently on and off. The underlying physical mechanism hinges on a systematic opening and closing of channels between transporting and nontransporting phase space structures upon switching and exploits cantori structures which generate memory effects in the population of these structures. Our results should allow for real-time control of cold thermal atomic ensembles in optical lattices but might also be useful as a design principle for targeted delivery of molecules or colloids in optical devices.}

The scheme employs a periodically shaken two-dimensional dissipative lattice and hinges on a simultaneous transport of particles in species-specific directions. This selective transport is achieved by controlling the late-time nonlinear particle dynamics, via the attractors embedded in the phase space and their bifurcations. To illustrate the spectrum of possible applications of the scheme, we exemplarily demonstrate the separation of polydisperse colloids and mixtures of cold thermal alkali atoms in optical lattices.}

  abstract = {We demonstrate the directed transport of underdamped particles in two-dimensional lattices of arbitrary geometry driven by an unbiased AC driving force. The direction of transport can be controlled via the lattice geometry as well as the strength and orientation of the oscillating drive. The breaking of the spatial inversion symmetry, which is necessary for the emergence of directed transport, is achieved solely due to the structure and geometry of the lattice. The most important criterion determining the transport direction is shown to be the ballistic attractors underlying the phase space of our weakly dissipative nonlinear dynamical system. This allows the prediction of transport direction even for setups like driven oblique lattices where the standard symmetry arguments of transport control fail. Our results can be experimentally realized using holographic optical-lattice-based setups with colloids or cold atoms.}
