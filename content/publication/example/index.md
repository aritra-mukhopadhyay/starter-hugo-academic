abstract: The past two decades have seen a remarkable progress in the
  development of synthetic colloidal agents which are capable of creating
  directed motion in an unbiased environment at the microscale. These
  self-propelling particles are often praised for their enormous potential to
  self-organize into dynamic nonequilibrium structures such as living clusters,
  synchronized super-rotor structures or self-propelling molecules featuring a
  complexity which is rarely found outside of the living world. However, the
  precise mechanisms underlying the formation and dynamics of many of these
  structures are still barely understood, which is likely to hinge on the gaps
  in our understanding of how active colloids interact. In particular, besides
  showing comparatively short-ranged interactions which are well known from
  passive colloids (Van der Waals, electrostatic etc), active colloids show
  novel hydrodynamic interactions as well as phoretic and substrate-mediated
  'osmotic' cross-interactions which hinge on the action of the phoretic field
  gradients which are induced by the colloids on other colloids in the system.
  The present article discusses the complexity and the intriguing properties of
  these interactions which in general are long-ranged, non-instantaneous,
  non-pairwise and non-reciprocal and which may serve as key ingredients for the
  design of future nonequilibrium colloidal materials. Besides providing a brief
  overview on the state of the art of our understanding of these interactions a
  key aim of this review is to emphasize open key questions and corresponding
  open challenges.
