abstract: We show that the direction of directed particle transport in a two-dimensional
  ac-driven lattice can be dynamically reversed by changing the structure of the lattice
  in the direction perpendicular to the applied driving force. These structural changes
  introduce dimensional coupling effects, the strength of which governs the timescale
  of the current reversals. The underlying mechanism is based on the fact that dimensional
  coupling allows the particles to explore regions of phase space which are inaccessible
  otherwise. The experimental realization for cold atoms in ac-driven optical lattices
  is discussed.
