 abstract = {We demonstrate the control of vortical motion of neutral classical particles in driven superlattices. Our superlattice consists of a superposition of individual lattices whose potential depths are modulated periodically in time but with different phases. This driving scheme breaks the spatial reflection symmetries and allows an ensemble of particles to rotate with an average angular velocity. An analysis of the underlying dynamical attractors provides an efficient method to control the angular velocities of the particles by changing the driving amplitude. As a result, spatially periodic patterns of particles showing different vortical motions can be created. Possible experimental realizations include holographic optical lattice based setups for colloids or cold atoms.},
