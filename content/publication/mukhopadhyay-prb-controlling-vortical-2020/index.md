abstract: We demonstrate the control of vortical motion of neutral classical particles
  in driven superlattices. Our superlattice consists of a superposition of individual
  lattices whose potential depths are modulated periodically in time but with different
  phases. This driving scheme breaks the spatial reflection symmetries and allows
  an ensemble of particles to rotate with an average angular velocity. An analysis
  of the underlying dynamical attractors provides an efficient method to control the
  angular velocities of the particles by changing the driving amplitude. As a result,
  spatially periodic patterns of particles showing different vortical motions can
  be created. Possible experimental realizations include holographic optical lattice
  based setups for colloids or cold atoms.
