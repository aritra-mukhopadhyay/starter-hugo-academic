abstract: We demonstrate the directed transport of underdamped particles in two-dimensional
  lattices of arbitrary geometry driven by an unbiased AC driving force. The direction
  of transport can be controlled via the lattice geometry as well as the strength
  and orientation of the oscillating drive. The breaking of the spatial inversion
  symmetry, which is necessary for the emergence of directed transport, is achieved
  solely due to the structure and geometry of the lattice. The most important criterion
  determining the transport direction is shown to be the ballistic attractors underlying
  the phase space of our weakly dissipative nonlinear dynamical system. This allows
  the prediction of transport direction even for setups like driven oblique lattices
  where the standard symmetry arguments of transport control fail. Our results can
  be experimentally realized using holographic optical-lattice-based setups with colloids
  or cold atoms.
