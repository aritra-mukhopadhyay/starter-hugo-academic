 abstract = {We demonstrate the directed transport of underdamped particles in two-dimensional lattices of arbitrary geometry driven by an unbiased AC driving force. The direction of transport can be controlled via the lattice geometry as well as the strength and orientation of the oscillating drive. The breaking of the spatial inversion symmetry, which is necessary for the emergence of directed transport, is achieved solely due to the structure and geometry of the lattice. The most important criterion determining the transport direction is shown to be the ballistic attractors underlying the phase space of our weakly dissipative nonlinear dynamical system. This allows the prediction of transport direction even for setups like driven oblique lattices where the standard symmetry arguments of transport control fail. Our results can be experimentally realized using holographic optical-lattice-based setups with colloids or cold atoms.},
