 abstract = {We demonstrate that directed transport of particles in a two dimensional driven lattice can be dynamically reversed multiple times by superimposing additional spatially localized lattices on top of a background lattice. The timescales of such current reversals can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the spatial locations of the superimposed lattices. The key principle behind the current reversals is the conversion of the particle dynamics from chaotic to ballistic, which allow the particles to explore regions of the underlying phase space which are inaccessible otherwise. Our results can be experimentally realized using cold atoms in driven optical lattices and allow for the control of transport of atomic ensembles in such setups.},
