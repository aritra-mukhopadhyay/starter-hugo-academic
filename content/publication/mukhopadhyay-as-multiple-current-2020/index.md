abstract: We demonstrate that directed transport of particles in a two dimensional
  driven lattice can be dynamically reversed multiple times by superimposing additional
  spatially localized lattices on top of a background lattice. The timescales of such
  current reversals can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the spatial locations
  of the superimposed lattices. The key principle behind the current reversals is
  the conversion of the particle dynamics from chaotic to ballistic, which allow the
  particles to explore regions of the underlying phase space which are inaccessible
  otherwise. Our results can be experimentally realized using cold atoms in driven
  optical lattices and allow for the control of transport of atomic ensembles in such
  setups.
