 abstract = {Following the connection of the non-linear Schr√∂dinger equation with the continuum Heisenberg spin chain, we find the rogue soliton equivalent in the spin system. The breathers are also mapped to the corresponding space or time localized oscillatory modes, through the moving curve analogy. The spatio-temporal evolution of the curvature and torsion of the curve, underlying these dynamical systems, are explicated to illustrate the localization property of the rogue waves.},
