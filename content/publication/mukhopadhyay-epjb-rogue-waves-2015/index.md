abstract: Following the connection of the non-linear Schr√∂dinger equation with the
  continuum Heisenberg spin chain, we find the rogue soliton equivalent in the spin
  system. The breathers are also mapped to the corresponding space or time localized
  oscillatory modes, through the moving curve analogy. The spatio-temporal evolution
  of the curvature and torsion of the curve, underlying these dynamical systems, are
  explicated to illustrate the localization property of the rogue waves.
