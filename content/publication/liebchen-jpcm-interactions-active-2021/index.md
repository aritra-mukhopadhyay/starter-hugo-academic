abstract: The past two decades have seen a remarkable progress in the development
  of synthetic colloidal agents which are capable of creating directed motion in an
  unbiased environment at the microscale. These self-propelling particles are often
  praised for their enormous potential to self-organize into dynamic nonequilibrium
  structures such as living clusters, synchronized super-rotor structures or self-propelling
  molecules featuring a complexity which is rarely found outside of the living world.
  However, the precise mechanisms underlying the formation and dynamics of many of
  these structures are still barely understood, which is likely to hinge on the gaps
  in our understanding of how active colloids interact. In particular, besides showing
  comparatively short-ranged interactions which are well known from passive colloids
  (Van der Waals, electrostatic etc), active colloids show novel hydrodynamic interactions
  as well as phoretic and substrate-mediated `osmotic' cross-interactions which hinge
  on the action of the phoretic field gradients which are induced by the colloids
  on other colloids in the system. The present article discusses the complexity and
  the intriguing properties of these interactions which in general are long-ranged,
  non-instantaneous, non-pairwise and non-reciprocal and which may serve as key ingredients
  for the design of future nonequilibrium colloidal materials. Besides providing a
  brief overview on the state of the art of our understanding of these interactions
  a key aim of this review is to emphasize open key questions and corresponding open
  challenges.
