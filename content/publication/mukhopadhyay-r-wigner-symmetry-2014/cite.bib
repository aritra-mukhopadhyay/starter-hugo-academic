 abstract = {This article elucidates the important role the notion of symmetry has played in physics. It discusses the proof of one of the important theorems of quantum mechanics, viz., Wigner's Symmetry Representation Theorem. It also shows how the representations of various continuous and discrete symmetries follow from the theorem and at last provides an explicit form of the anti-unitary time-reversal operator.},
