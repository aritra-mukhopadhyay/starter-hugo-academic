abstract: This article elucidates the important role the notion of symmetry has played
  in physics. It discusses the proof of one of the important theorems of quantum mechanics,
  viz., Wigner's Symmetry Representation Theorem. It also shows how the representations
  of various continuous and discrete symmetries follow from the theorem and at last
  provides an explicit form of the anti-unitary time-reversal operator.
