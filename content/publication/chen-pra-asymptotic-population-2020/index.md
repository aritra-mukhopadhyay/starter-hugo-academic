abstract: We demonstrate that an ultracold many-body bosonic ensemble confined in
  a one-dimensional double-well potential exhibits a population imbalance between
  the two wells at large timescales, when the depth of the wells is modulated by a
  time-dependent driving force. The specific form of the driving force is shown to
  break spatial parity and time-reversal symmetries, which leads to such an asymptotic
  population imbalance (API). The value of the API can be flexibly controlled by changing
  the phase of the driving force and the total number of particles. While the API
  is highly sensitive to the initial state in the few-particle regime, this dependence
  on the initial state is lost as we approach the classical limit of large particle
  numbers. We perform a Floquet analysis in the few-particle regime and an analysis
  based on a driven classical nonrigid pendulum in the many-particle regime. Although
  the obtained API values in the many-particle regime agree very well with those obtained
  in the classical limit, we show that there exists a significant disagreement in
  the corresponding real-time population imbalance due to quantum correlations.
