 abstract = {We provide a generic scheme to separate the particles of a mixture by their physical properties like mass, friction, or size. The scheme employs a periodically shaken two-dimensional dissipative lattice and hinges on a simultaneous transport of particles in species-specific directions. This selective transport is achieved by controlling the late-time nonlinear particle dynamics, via the attractors embedded in the phase space and their bifurcations. To illustrate the spectrum of possible applications of the scheme, we exemplarily demonstrate the separation of polydisperse colloids and mixtures of cold thermal alkali atoms in optical lattices.},
