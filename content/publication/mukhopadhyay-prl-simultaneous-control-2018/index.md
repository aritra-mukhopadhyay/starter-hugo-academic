abstract: We provide a generic scheme to separate the particles of a mixture by their
  physical properties like mass, friction, or size. The scheme employs a periodically
  shaken two-dimensional dissipative lattice and hinges on a simultaneous transport
  of particles in species-specific directions. This selective transport is achieved
  by controlling the late-time nonlinear particle dynamics, via the attractors embedded
  in the phase space and their bifurcations. To illustrate the spectrum of possible
  applications of the scheme, we exemplarily demonstrate the separation of polydisperse
  colloids and mixtures of cold thermal alkali atoms in optical lattices.
