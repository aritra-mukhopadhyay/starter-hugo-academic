abstract: We provide a generic scheme offering real-time control of directed particle
  transport using superimposed driven lattices. This scheme allows one to accelerate,
  slow, and freeze the transport on demand by switching one of the lattices subsequently
  on and off. The underlying physical mechanism hinges on a systematic opening and
  closing of channels between transporting and nontransporting phase space structures
  upon switching and exploits cantori structures which generate memory effects in
  the population of these structures. Our results should allow for real-time control
  of cold thermal atomic ensembles in optical lattices but might also be useful as
  a design principle for targeted delivery of molecules or colloids in optical devices.
